# Chris Burgin Common Tools
Common configs that I use in my projects

## Install
`npm install chrisburgin-common-tools -g`

## Usage
`cbct install`

## ToDo
- [ ] Place the config files in a `.settings` folder and extend those files. This would allow the user to add their own custom configs while still being able to update.
- [ ] Editor extension that would tell you if your settings where out of date. This would be cool!
